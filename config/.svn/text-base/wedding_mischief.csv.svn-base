being caught stealing roast swan from the scully
calling a visiting lady fat
chasing the Lord's dogs through the muddy field
setting off firecrackers near the elderly maid
shooting peas at well wishers
loudly proclaiming there was no God
throwing a tantrum during the main meal
being obnoxious to all the guests
making a rude gesture at the Groom
calling the Bride ugly
being caught spitting in the soup
being caught peeing in pudding
running naked round the aisles during the ceremony
